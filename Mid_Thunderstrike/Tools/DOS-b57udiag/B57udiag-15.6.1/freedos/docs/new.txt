1.0 Final changes:
*See history.txt

changes:
*SYS: kernel32 only (kernel.sys), kernel16.sys in other package
*UDMA2: replaced UDMAX (UDMA2 v1.5 versus UDMA v7.0)
*EMM386: updated HIMEM+EMM386, VDS support, 
         bootdisk uses compressed older HIMEM release
*EDIT: version 0.82
*Windows NT dualboot added, works (finally!)
*Windows NT overwriting of system files fixed completely
*Memtest+ has been updated to v1.30
*Contents of directly usable ODIN disk has been added to cdrom
*Contents of a testing bootdisk has been merged with special bootdisk fdos1440.img
*Config.sys will have a EMM386 first, then HIMEM, then Clean Boot
 (each item decreases amount of conventionel memory)

Optional:
*GUI_INST sources + Linux theme ?
*Installer update to v3.7.7 ?

Issues:
*MetaKern bootmenu CPU-specific please.
 pre-386 should go to option2 (work from diskette), 
 386+ should go to option1 (menu).

*Metaboot should have an alternative option to load bootsector from disk
 before patching it, instead of retrieving it from RAM.
 FD-bootsector -> syslinux bootsector -> syslinux -> freedos bootsector -> freedos
 -or (better)
 FD-bootsector -> syslinux bootsector -> syslinux -> metaboot -> freedos

*DOS=HIGH is still buggy with HTMLHELP (empty screen)
*compressed memtestp.bin would be nice to save diskspace
*display should have an errorlevel for 'hey, I already installed before'
*display should loadhigh if first driver in autoexec.bat
*EDIT does not open a hidden file (attrib +h test.txt ; edit test.txt)
