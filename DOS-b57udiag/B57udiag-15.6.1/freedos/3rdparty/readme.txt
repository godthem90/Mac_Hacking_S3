FreeDOS 1.0 Final distribution.

1) external files.

Due to proper functioning of equivalent replacements in the
freedos software, or lack of the software,
we're using a few external programs.
Some have the same license as FreeDOS (GPL), and thus can be easily
distributed with it. Some have a different license.

2) Programs.

-Extract, Gilles Vollant.
 usage:   extract files from a diskette image file to a diskette,
          implemented by the bootdisk.bat file.
          missing FreeDOS function: UNDELETE /extract , DISKCOPY /RESIZE
          missing FreeDOS program : PDFIT (Jeremy Davis)
 license: Freeware for all kinds of use

-Eltorito.sys , Bart Lagerweij
 usage:   provide cdrom access outside of the booted diskette image,
          to let the install program run so FreeDOS can be installed.
 license: we have permission to distribute the binary.
