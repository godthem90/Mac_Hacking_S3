Welcome to the 1.0 Final distribution!

Please visit the FreeDOS web site ( http://www.freedos.org ) for more
information on FreeDOS, including updates.

Please read and understand the licensing information for all programs
you install and use.

For a list of programs available in this distribution see the file
programs.txt, which includes information such as program name, license
(copying information, note some programs may be available only for
non-commercial use), and primary location to obtain program.


In the meantime, some notes and things you need to watch out for:

* The Fat32 enabled kernel has gone out of the experimental phase
  for quite some time. It's now stable.
  However, not all FreeDOS programs can handle FAT32 properly yet.

* This distribution is provided only as an ISO image.  Though
  disk images may be provided in a form suitable for 3.5inch
  1.44MB floppies and others to allow booting from floppy and
  using the CD-ROM.

* About bootdisk:
  The contents of the first disk is small enough to fit on diskettes
  ranging from 360KB to 2.88MB (most common: 1.44KB).
  
* About bootdisk creation:
  If an empty diskette is inserted, we create a standard FreeDOS diskette.
