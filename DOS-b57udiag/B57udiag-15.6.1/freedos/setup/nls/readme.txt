Please compare contents carefully to English file.
Same entries (x.y:string) might contain different strings!
English file is always up2date, and Dutch one probably also.

If your file is up2date, please give it a 2-letter extension,
depending on your language.
Any outdated language is marked by a T on the end,
like LOCALIZE.DET instead of LOCALIZE.DE
